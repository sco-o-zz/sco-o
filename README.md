👋 Hi, I’m @sco-o, this Github is going to be mainly used for my hobbyist programming/hardware projects - hopefully someone finds it interesting 🙃

If I'm knocking something up quickly that isn't performance-critical (which probably encompasses all my hobby projects) or if I'm not using the optimal application-specific libraries, then it's probably going to be in Python🐍 or for larger projects I might treat myself to some C##️⃣.
